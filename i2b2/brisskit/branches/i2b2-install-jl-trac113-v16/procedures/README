#===============================================================================#
#  Command line tools for installing an i2b2 domain and one demo project.       #
#===============================================================================#
Still under development.

QUICK START.
============

1. Unzip this package into a convenient place on a server hosting an i2b2 domain.
2. Set the I2B2_INSTALL_HOME environment variable and export it.
3. Ensure the following environment variables are set within the defaults.sh config file.
     JAVA_HOME 
     ANT_HOME 
     JBOSS_HOME
4  If you wish to run procedures from any current directory,
   run the build-symlinks script in the bin/utility directory  
   and add the bin/symlinks to your path. 
   But go steady; this could wait until later.
5  Review configuration settings within the config directory.
   Basically these files:
    procedures/config/jboss/run.conf
    procedures/config/jboss/server.xml
    procedures/config/defaults.sh
    procedures/config/config.propertie
6. The order of completion is by number within the procedures/bin/installs directory

Inspect the POM.
================

There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions)... 

To build a production artifact, the default install invocation is sufficient...
mvn install

To build a development artifact...
mvn install -Denvironment.type=development

The development version has facilities for dropping all sql artifacts. 
Hence you must explicitly request a development build.

NOTES:
======

(1) The stopping and starting of JBoss needs looking at.
